# Optimal Single Target Gates

Benchmarks/description originally found from http://quantumfpl.stationq.com/


The hybrid mapping method in LUT-based hierarchical reversible synthesis (LHRS) is based on replacing reversible single-target gates with up to 4-variable control functions into optimum or optimal Clifford+T networks. It has been shown that two functions which are equivalent up to affine transformations on the inputs and negation at the output have the same number of T gates in their optimum Clifford+T networks. Consequently, it is sufficient to find an optimum network for one function representative of each class. All such classes for 2-, 3-, and 4-variable functions (except the constant function) are listed here, together with the current best known Clifford+T network. #1, #3, #03, #0f, #000f, #00ff have a number of T gates proven to be optimum.  Each network can be downloaded as image, real file, QC file, and qcode file.
